## COMPASS

Their website : [Compass](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/)

### Why Sprites for Web apps?

Simply because you need your website to be fast to load. It means 2 things:

* light, low-sized files.
* less network traffic as possible, less ressources to load.

### Why Compass?

Because it's not framework dependent, easy to use and SASS Compliant.

* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">SCSS</a> could be better but is not implemented yet.
* It has a watcher which can convert on the fly your scss when there is a change.
